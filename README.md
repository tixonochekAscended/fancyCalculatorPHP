# 💻 "Fancy" calculator made with the usage of HTML, CSS & PHP
### ⭐ This has been my best project yet. It has a lot more PHP code in comparsion to previous projects.
### 📜 Since the planning process the code had some major flaws, that I decided were okay (spoiler: they weren't). That's why the PHP code for this calculator is a bit weird and has some mistakes, and I fully know about them.
